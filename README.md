# Bank_Management_project
Built a Bank Management System in Java! üè¶ Excited to share my recent project: a Bank Management System built entirely in Java. This project was a great opportunity to practice my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and user input/output. 
Here's what it can do:

Create and manage customer accounts: Add new customers, update their information, and maintain their account balances.
Perform transactions: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
Generate reports: Provide summaries of customer accounts and transactions.
Technical Stack:

Java
Maven for project management
JUnit for testing
H2 Database for data persistence (ideal for testing and development)
Key Learnings:

Object-oriented design: Modeling real-world concepts (customers, accounts, transactions) using classes and objects.
Data Structures: Using arrays and collections to efficiently store and manage data.
Input/Output: Handling user input and providing clear output to the user.
Next Steps:

Integrating with a real database: Moving from H2 to a more robust database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Implementing additional features: Adding functionalities like loan processing, account statements, and security measures.
This project was a fun and challenging learning experience. I'm always looking to improve my skills and build innovative software applications!
